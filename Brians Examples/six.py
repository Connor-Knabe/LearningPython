#This is the same problem as problem two but you can't use any loops.
#Given an input array, return that array reversed.
#Obviously another recursion problem.
#Oh and by the way, I just remembered that you can reverse an array using the .reverse() method.
#Obviously that is no fun so I've put some code in to stop you from doing that.

#run with: python test.py six

#0th index 

def helper(arr,i):
	arr_size = len(arr)
	print arr_size

	temp = arr[i]



def reverse(arr):
	#Your code goes here and remember you can add other methods to help out if you like.
	helper(arr,0)
