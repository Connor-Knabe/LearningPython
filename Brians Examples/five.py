# This problem is exactly the same as the first one except you can't use any loops.
# Hint: recursion, recursion, recursion
# and sense this is a particularly tough one, I've provided you with part of the solution.

#Run with: python test.py five

def helper(sol_arr, arr, i):
    #Your code goes here

def times2(arr):
    sol_arr = []
    solution_arr = helper(sol_arr, arr, 0)
    return solution_arr
