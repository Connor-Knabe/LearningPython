Connor,

Work your way through each of the five problems, I have provided an empty function for each problem along with a description in each file.

For the first problem, you will be given an array and will need to return the array or a version of the array with each number in the array multiplied by two.

For the second problem, you will be given an array and will need to return that array reversed

For the third problem, you will be given an unsorted array and will need to sort it

The fourth problem is the fizzbuzz problem

The fifth problem is the same as the first problem but you can't use loops

each problem can be run with the command python test.py <problem_number>

Documentation:

if statement:

if i > 0:
	do something
elif i == 0:
	do something
elif i < -10:
	do something
else:
	do something

'or' and 'and' and 'not operator examples:
	if x > 0 and x < 10:
		do something
	elif x > 0 or x < 10:
		do something
	elif not (x < 10):
		do something

note: Python literally uses the words or, and, not

looping through an array:
	for item in arr:
		do something

normal for loop in objective-c
	for(int i = 0; i < whatever: i++){
		do something
	}

normal for loop in python:
	for i in range(0, whatever):
		do something

while loop:
	while True:
		do something

array stuff:
	length of array = len(array)
	arrays are pretty much the same as most languages so things like arr[i] work just fine
